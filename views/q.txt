so tell me what is filtering i mean whn you use /admin/pp url then we dont have to specify 
that in router/admin.js file we just write app.use('/admin',adminrouter ) explian how
these thing work??
why do we path
why do we use ../ in path.join method
what is benefit of router.get method instaed of router.use
what is meaning of __dirname in path.join method
what is use of expree.static middle and why it is needed 
what will happen if two css file in html
what does this line does "module.exports = path.dirname(require.main.filename);" and why
do we use it??

here why did we export it like that exports.router = router,exports.product = product;
and in app.js why did we write it like this 'app.use("/admin", admindata.router);'

what does this line do app.set("view engine", "pug");
what does this line do app.set("views", __dirname + "/views");

in shop.js does express already know that when we use res.render we are looking to render
pug file ??

in shop.pug why did we use each product in data to render data on screen and why we use 
product .title in h1 of shop.pug;

how we use the extend thing and made a main_layout file and how did we use that 

how we dynamically render our title and active class inside our nav links 

what is controller why we created every function in controller and render in router 
why didnt we do that there only 

what is model and we created class product
